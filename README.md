Avinoam is my grandfather, he is zoologist, biologist and prisoner restorer who managed the Haifa Zoo and Wildlife Park from 1970 to 2004.                  
Avinoam defined dozens of fish species, among them a subspecies of Epinefelus tauvina that crossed from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal. 
Avinoam was involved in the development and design of zoos in Israel and was involved in many areas of volunteering throughout his life
